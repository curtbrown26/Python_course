# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

#### Import & Clean Up Data

I begin by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset. This is followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# import libararies
import pandas as pd
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import ast
import seaborn as sns

# load data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# data cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)

```

# Filter UK Jobs

```python
df_UK = df[df['job_country'] == 'United Kingdom']
```
To focus my analysis on the UK job market, I applied filters to the dataset, narrowing it down to roles based in the.

# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data science roles in the UK? 

To identify the most in-demand skills for the top three popular data roles, I filtered the job positions to determine the most prevalent roles. Subsequently, I extracted the top five skills for each of these roles. This analysis reveals the most popular job titles and their essential skills, providing guidance on which competencies to prioritize based on the targeted role.

### Visualise Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    
    sns.barplot(
        data=df_plot,
        x='skill_percent',
        y='job_skills',
        ax=ax[i],
        hue='skill_count',
        palette='dark:r_r'
    )
    
plt.show()
```
